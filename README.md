# CubeHARM

Cube-HARM is a graphical modelling tool developed on top of previous work by Nhung H. Nguyen et al..
It enables in-depth threat analysis and defence evaluation of CubeSat systems by combining attack graphs and attack trees with formal security metrics.

## Overview

Cube-Harm is built to support Cube Satellite security researchers and developers by offering:

1. Web-based visualisation of CubeSat attack paths.
2. Automatic calculation of multi-level security metrics.
3. Analysis of the impact and probability of attacks.
4. Flexible modelling of CubeSats.
5. Secrurity prioritisation

## To use Cube-HARM:

1. Go to the Cube-HARM [AttackModel.html](https://alexanderdgraves.github.io/CubeHARM2/AttackModel.html) site.
2. Prepare CubeSat architecture in JSON format (see sample files `/scenario`).
3. Copy the JSON content and paste it into the input field.
4. Click the `Process Data` button to generate the attack graphs and calculate security metrics automatically.
